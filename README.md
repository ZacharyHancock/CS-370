Deep Q-Learning Agent, made to learn how to navigate a maze to treasure

What code were you given? 
The code I was given was the creation of the environment, possible actions, play_game function, completion function, and the neural network model itself.

What code did you create yourself?
The code I created was the deep-Q learning algorithmn itself. I did this by creating a loop for each epoch that resets the maze state, then chooses a random action based on exploration or explotation based on the epsilon, assign the action, store the episode, then do it over again until it reaches 100% win rate.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists construct instructions for computers to complete an action. This has now evloved to creating algorithmns like the deep-Q learning that gives the computer a semblance of human reasoning. This matters because there are many problems in the world that are solved and made more efficient for the betterment of society. For instance, modern AI now has the ability to disocver new drugs that can help save more lived.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach a problem systematically by breaking down the components of the problem. Like a traditional software development lifecylce there are design and development phases, I break down the problem to its needs and accomplish each need one at a time until I have a final product. Then at the end polish it and deliver it.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibilites for modern day AI is to be aware of user privacy and bias. Users deserve the right to be forgotten, data usage transparency, and understanding of how its being used. This ensures there arent malicious things being done with the data, protecting their PII. Secondly, bias in AI becomes an issue as the training data and practicioners of the AI instill their implicit bias in the model.
